Performance has been greatly improved thanks to removing the priorityqueue debugging method. However there is still some spikes in performance. Some possible causes are:
-ScenarioData.ComputePath() in general.
	-ScenarioData.ComputePath() -> SearchNode.GetChildren() can be improved.
	-ScenarioData.ComputePath() -> HeapPriorityQueue ... ctor() can be improved?
-PostLateUpdate.FinishFrameRendering maybe should be looked into?

Bugs: 
-An error in citizen manager? Something is null?
	- Look into CitizenManager ... MoveNext().

-MAYBE: Bug with delivery guys standing around?
